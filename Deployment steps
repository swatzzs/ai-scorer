1. Local Deployment Guide (Run on Your Laptop)
1.1. Prerequisites

Python 3.10+ installed

Git installed (optional but recommended)

Any modern web browser (Chrome / Edge / Firefox)

Internet connection (first time, to download dependencies and models)

1.2. Get the Project Code

Option A – Clone from GitHub (recommended)

Open a terminal (VS Code terminal is fine).

Navigate to the folder where you want the project, e.g.:

cd C:\Users\<YourName>\Desktop


Clone the repository:

git clone https://github.com/<your-username>/<your-repo-name>.git
cd <your-repo-name>


Option B – Manual download

Download the project as a ZIP from GitHub.

Extract the ZIP to a folder (e.g., C:\Users\<YourName>\Desktop\nirmaan-ai-communication-scorer).

Open a terminal in that folder.

1.3. Create and Activate a Virtual Environment (Windows)

Create a virtual environment:

python -m venv venv


Activate it (PowerShell):

.\venv\Scripts\Activate.ps1


If you see an error about execution policy, run:

Set-ExecutionPolicy -Scope Process -ExecutionPolicy Bypass
.\venv\Scripts\Activate.ps1


After activation, your prompt should start with (venv).

1.4. Install Dependencies

With the virtual environment active, run:

pip install --upgrade pip
pip install -r requirements.txt


If torch fails to install from requirements.txt, you can install it manually:

pip install torch --index-url https://download.pytorch.org/whl/cpu

1.5. Run the Local Server

Ensure you are in the project folder (where app.py is located).

Run the Flask app:

python app.py


You should see output similar to:

* Running on http://127.0.0.1:5000/ (Press CTRL+C to quit)


This means the local server is running.

1.6. Open the Web Application

Open your web browser.

Go to:

http://127.0.0.1:5000/


You will see the Nirmaan AI – Spoken Communication Scorer interface:

A text area to paste the transcript

An optional field for audio duration (seconds)

A Score button

Paste a self-introduction transcript into the text area, optionally enter duration in seconds, and click Score.

The app will display:

Overall score (0–100)

Total word count

A table of per-criterion scores and feedback (content, structure, grammar, clarity, engagement, etc.)

1.7. Stop the Local Server

When you are done:

Go back to the terminal where python app.py is running.

Press:

Ctrl + C
